Description: Provide a series of functions to conduct a meta analysis of 
    factor analysis based on co-occurrence matrices. The tool can be used to 
    solve the factor structure (i.e. inner structure of a construct, or scale) 
    debate in several disciplines, such as psychology, psychiatry, management, 
    education so on. References: Shafer (2005) <doi:10.1037/1040-3590.17.3.324>;
